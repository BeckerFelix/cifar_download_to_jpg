# cifar_download_to_jpg

This script gets the **Cifar10** dataset and exports each image as separate .jpg file. The files are stored according to given train/val ratio, where the folder name corresponds to the object class.  Really simple script which might hopefully help someone ;)

Data is gathered from cs.toronto.edu

Use with python 2.7
